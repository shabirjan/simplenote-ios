# Simplenote for iOS
A Simplenote client for iOS. Learn more about Simplenote at [Simplenote.com](https://simplenote.com).

## Development Requirements
* [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/).
* [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).

## Running

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/Automattic/simplenote-ios.git`
2. Run `pod install` from the root directory, and then open `Simplenote.xcworkspace` file in Xcode.
3. Sign up for a new account within the app. Use the account for **testing purposes only** as all note data will be periodically cleared out on the server.

_Note: Simplenote API features such as sharing and publishing will not work with development builds._
